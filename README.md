> An experimental device driver for the Logitech 3D Pro joystick for Linux platforms. 

# Description
UPDATE: I am unable to find the necessary information I need to receive the joysticks input and map it to a keystroke or a slider value. One or two sources I have found indicate that this joystick is not supported on Linux. 

I will continue to look for sources that would indicate otherwise, and technical information on the joystick that I could work with. However, the joystick is a rather dated model and I do not expect to find much. As such this project is on hold until I have made significant progress in my other projects, and have found the information and time necessary to continue my systems-level projects.

This project is intended to serve as a an input driver for the Logitech 3D Pro joystick on Linux systems, as seen below.

A driver like this is especially suitable for certain games which have in-built support for certain joysticks, but do not recognize all joysticks, such as Ace Combat 7. Should this driver work, you will be able to simply plug-and-play this joystick and use it for any game, as it aims to map the joystick inputs to keystrokes. 
This project is still under development.

# Installation & Environment
Instructions to be released once a fully working model is developed.
